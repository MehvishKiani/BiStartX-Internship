# Predictive Modeling for Breast Cancer Diagnosis

**Internship Task (Week 6-7) - BiStartX**

## 📌 Project Title:
Predictive Modeling for Breast Cancer Diagnosis

## 📝 Description:
This project involves developing a machine learning model to classify breast cancer tumors as either benign or malignant using the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset**. 

The objective is to assist in early and accurate cancer detection using key diagnostic features extracted from cell nuclei. The project includes:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Model Selection (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM)
- Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

## 📊 Dataset:
The dataset used is the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset**, containing 569 samples with 30 real-valued features.

## 💻 Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Results:
The Random Forest and SVM models achieved high accuracy, making them suitable for early cancer diagnosis tasks.
